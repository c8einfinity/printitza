# Sales Representative

Our dev team has created a new easily managed Sales Representative extension for Magento2 to help you forget about manual work.

It allows you to assign orders, customers or certain products to a specific rep.

If the order is created by Sales Rep in Magento admin, SR can be assigned to the order automatically.

You can manage commissionsâ€™ rate for each representative separately.

You can set up different rates for products, orders or customers.

Sales Representative extension adds a new column to the order grid for the sales tracking.

There is a new tab with sales rep information in the order view.

There are few reports for better management: the report by-products, the report by customer, the report by orders, the report by SR.
